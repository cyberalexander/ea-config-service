Config Server for Eagle Eye application.

## About
The Spring Cloud configuration server is a REST-based application thatâ€™s built on top of Spring Boot. 
It doesn't come as a standalone server. Instead, you can choose to either embed it in an existing 
Spring Boot application or start a new Spring Boot project with the server embedded it.
